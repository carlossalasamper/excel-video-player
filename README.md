## Build Excel Add-ins Using Office Add-ins Development Kit

Excel add-ins are integrations built by third parties into Excel by using [Excel JavaScript API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/reference/overview/excel-add-ins-reference-overview) and [Office Platform capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins).

## How To Run This Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (the latest LTS version). Visit the [Node.js site](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install the right version for your operating system. To verify that you've already installed these tools, run the commands `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
- Office connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription. You might qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program), see [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-) for details. Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try?rtc=1) or [purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products).

### Run the Add-in Using Office Add-ins Development Kit Extension

1. **Open the Office Add-ins Development Kit**

   In the **Activity Bar**, select the **Office Add-ins Development Kit** icon to open the extension.

1. **Preview Your Office Add-in (F5)**

   Select **Preview Your Office Add-in(F5)** to launch the add-in and debug the code. In the Quick Pick menu, select the option **Excel Desktop (Edge Chromium)**.

   The extension then checks that the prerequisites are met before debugging starts. Check the terminal for detailed information if there are issues with your environment. After this process, the Excel desktop application launches and sideloads the add-in.

1. **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**

   Once you are finished testing and debugging the add-in, select **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**. This closes the web server and removes the add-in from the registry and cache.

## Use the Add-in Project

The add-in project that you've created contains sample code for a basic task pane add-in.

## Explore the Add-in Code

To explore an Office add-in project, you can start with the key files listed below.

- The `./manifest.xml` file in the root directory of the project defines the settings and capabilities of the add-in. <br>You can check whether your manifest file is valid by selecting **Validate Manifest File** option from the Office Add-ins Development Kit.
- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.html` file contains the HTML markup for the task pane.
- The `./src/taskpane/**/*.tsx` file contains the react code and Office JavaScript API code that facilitates interaction between the task pane and the Excel application.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems running the add-in, take these steps.

- Close any open instances of Excel.
- Close the previous web server started for the add-in with the **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in** Office Add-ins Development Kit extension option.

If you still have problems, see [troubleshoot development errors](https://learn.microsoft.com//office/dev/add-ins/testing/troubleshoot-development-errors) or [create a GitHub issue](https://aka.ms/officedevkitnewissue) and we'll help you.

For information on running the add-in on Excel on the web, see [Sideload Office Add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing).

For information on debugging on older versions of Office, see [Debug add-ins using developer tools in Microsoft Edge Legacy](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-devtools-edge-legacy).

## Make Code Changes

All the information about Office Add-ins is found in our [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). You can also explore more samples in the Office Add-ins Development Kit. Select **View Samples** to see more samples of real-world scenarios.

If you edit the manifest as part of your changes, use the **Validate Manifest File** option in the Office Add-ins Development Kit. This shows you errors in the manifest syntax.
